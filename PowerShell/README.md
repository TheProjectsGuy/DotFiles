# PowerShell

[PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) is an amazing shell (all outputs are objects, not texts).

## Extensions

Powershell, like `zsh`, can be heavily customized. Check out [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/pwsh) and install the `Meso LG M Bold Nerd Font Complete.ttf` and `agave regular Nerd Font Complete.ttf` (across all users) from [here](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/fonts). The theme currently being used is `gmay`. This is best enjoyed with Windows Terminal.
