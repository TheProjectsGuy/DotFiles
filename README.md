## New machine

- If using multiple systems and want to share keyboard and mouse, use [barrier](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/).
- Use [CopyQ](https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/) clipboard manager for Linux.
- Monitoring usage using [gotop](https://github.com/xxxserxxx/gotop) is amazing. You may have to [fix version issue](https://github.com/xxxserxxx/gotop/issues/212#issuecomment-1153896038).
